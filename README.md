# BasicMathQuiz
This is a working(not efficiently) unfinished math quiz game.

# Description

This is a math quiz game I made for my cousin in kindergarden to practice her math. This was also one of my first projects; However
this was my first project I challenged myself to make using only knowledge from memory. In doing so i ran into quite a few problems.
My plan was to have a score and highscore so when you got a question wrong your current score would become the new highscore (if
higher than current highscore if any) but the quiz would stop working in a weird way after about 3 questions (I never solved this
bug so if anyone is reading this who has an idea let me know) so i ditched the score/highscore idea. As a temporary fix (which became forever)
after hitting get question, the code will work as it should and show correct answer in green and wrong in red. From there I just implemented a 
page refresh (this fixes the code bugging out after 3 consecutive questions). In doing so the new game button became useless but I left it there
for the one day I do come back to this to fix it. Overall, it worked for my cousin to practice because she wouldnt know the difference anyway.
